### Second test process crawling via api requests with limited number (up to 1000) and store results with fs.writeFileSync

### Third test process crawling via api requests with limited number (up to 1000) and store results with fs.createWritableStream

### Fourth test process crawling via api requests by batch (up to 1000) and store results with fs.createWritableStream
